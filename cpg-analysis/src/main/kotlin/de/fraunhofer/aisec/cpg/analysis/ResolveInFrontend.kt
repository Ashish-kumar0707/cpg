/**
 * This annotation is primarily a hint to the developer, that this function will make use of the
 * [ScopeManager.resolve] or a similar function within a language frontend. While we not encourage
 * this, sometimes it is unavoidable and thus should be marked as such. The drawback of resolving in
 * a language frontend is that at this time, the scope manager only has a limited view on the
 * overall source graph and might not find symbols defined in other translation units.
